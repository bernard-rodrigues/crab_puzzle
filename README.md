## Rules

### Objective:
The goal of the game is to align four dots of your color in a row either vertically or horizontally.

### Setup:
- The game board is a 6x6 grid.
- Each player has pieces represented by colored squares: ðŸŸ© and ðŸŸ¥.

### How to Move:
- On their turn, a player must move one of their dots.
- Dots can move in straight lines (vertically or horizontally) as far as possible.
- Movement stops when the dot reaches:
    - The edge of the board, or
    - Another dot (regardless of the owner).

### Winning the Game:
- The first player to align four dots in a row (vertically or horizontally) wins!
- Diagonal lines do not count.

### Game Flow:
- Players take turns moving one dot at a time.
- If no player aligns four dots, the game continues until a winner emerges.

### Tips:
- Block your opponentâ€™s moves while setting up your own alignment!
- Plan your moves strategically to maximize mobility.
