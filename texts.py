ðŸ¦€ Crab Puzzle Rules

1. Objective:
    The goal of the game is to align four dots of your color in a row either vertically or horizontally.

2. Setup:
    - The game board is a 6x6 grid.
    - Each player has pieces represented by colored squares: ðŸŸ© and ðŸŸ¥.

3. How to Move:
    - On their turn, a player must move one of their dots.
    - Dots can move in straight lines (vertically or horizontally) as far as possible.
    - Movement stops when the dot reaches:
        - The edge of the board, or
        - Another dot (regardless of the owner).

4. Winning the Game:
    - The first player to align four dots in a row (vertically or horizontally) wins!
    - Diagonal lines do not count.

5. Game Flow:
    - Players take turns moving one dot at a time.
    - If no player aligns four dots, the game continues until a winner emerges.

6. Tips:
    - Block your opponentâ€™s moves while setting up your own alignment!
    - Plan your moves strategically to maximize mobility.
